## 🎯 Why TinyChoices?

> 1 in 5 children globally are overweight or obese.  
> Yet most families and providers lack **clear, visual tools** to demonstrate how everyday choices affect long-term health.

**TinyChoices bridges this gap** with a gamified, 3D simulation where every lifestyle choice updates an avatar’s:
- 👶 Appearance & mood
- 📈 BMI percentile
- 🧠 Energy & health risk score
